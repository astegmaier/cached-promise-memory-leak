# Cached Promises Memory Leak</h1>

`This project contains a simple example of a very tricky memory leak. It is
a simplified version of something that is happening in a real production
app, with all non-essential parts stripped away. It may seem a bit weird,
but (trust me) in the real app, there are sensible reasons for wanting to
structure code this way.`
